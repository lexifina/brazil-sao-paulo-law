# São Paulo: law history in git

The law of the State of São Paulo (Estado de São Paulo) (Brazil) as a git history: one file per Artigo, one paragraph per line, so `git blame`, `git log` and `git diff` work line by line. The text is Portuguese, the only official language.

It follows the shared design of [lexifina/global-law](https://github.com/lexifina/global-law).

## What this repository holds

| Folder | Act | Versions |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `constituicao/` | Constituição do Estado de São Paulo (5 October 1989), text in force | 1 |
| `lc-<year>-<number>/` | the Leis Complementares that ALESP lists as not expressly revoked ("sem revogação expressa") | 1 each |
| `lei-<year>-<number>/` | the ordinary Leis that ALESP lists as not expressly revoked; also `lei-<year>-sn-<ALESP id>/` for the numberless Leis of 1970-1972 | 1 each |

**Complete for what it covers:** the Constituição, every Lei Complementar (1,172) and every ordinary Lei (20,593) that ALESP lists as not expressly revoked. 49 listed Leis have no text page at ALESP, or only a PDF (budget tables), and are left out.

An act ALESP shows no alteration for is given **as enacted**, credited to the act itself. An altered act is given **only as its text in force**, credited to ALESP as the oldest version available: the wordings in between are not reconstructed yet, so no earlier version is shown rather than a wrong one. Decrees and the Emendas Constitucionais as acts are not included yet.

## Source

[ALESP, Legislação Estadual](https://www.al.sp.gov.br/legislacao), published by the Assembleia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo (ALESP). Each version names the page it was taken from and that page's sha256, in `data/versions.json`.

## Dates

An unaltered act is dated by its publication in the Diário Oficial do Estado (São Paulo laws almost always take effect on publication). An altered act's text in force is dated by the latest date among the alterations ALESP cites for it: its alteration notes ("redação dada pela ...", "revogado pela ..."), its "última atualização" line and the constitutional actions (ADI) it lists. Commits are at noon in São Paulo.

## How it is built

Lexifina reads the sources listed here and records each act's dated versions, and the laws that made each change, in one corpus file. `tools/build.py` writes this repository from that file, and the same corpus always gives the same commit hashes; `REPRODUCE.md` gives the details and the checks. A model (Claude) wrote Lexifina's code; it wrote no legal text, and no model runs when the history is built.

Each page becomes one file per Artigo; articles of the Ato das Disposições Transitórias are `adt-*`. Headings of the Títulos, Capítulos and Seções stand above the first article under them; `000-titulo.md` holds the title, the ementa and the preamble. For the text in force, the earlier wordings the portal strikes through and its alteration notes (italic paragraphs starting with "-") are left out; markers such as "(NR)" that belong to the text are kept. Tables are one line per row, with cells separated by ` | `.

## How it is checked

Every version is read back from git on the day it took effect (`tools/check_repo.py`) and must match the corpus; an independent letters-and-digits comparison of every version against the source page must show no difference. Results are in `REPRODUCE.md`.

## What "author" means

The author of each commit is the law that made the text, or, for a consolidated text, the publisher, with an e-mail address that cannot exist; the committer is always Lexifina.

## Limits

Not a complete history: an altered act starts at its text in force. The text is not the official version: only the Diário Oficial do Estado is authoritative. Text after the last article (place, date, signatures) stays in the last article's file.
